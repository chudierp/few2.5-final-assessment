## Lab

Todays goal is to start your final project. It's important for you to identify a dataset you will use for the project, identify the values you will display and in what axis, color, shape etc. and to get started coding. 

<!-- > -->

## Overview

- Look at data visualization types 
  - What type of data works best for each type?
- Look at data
  - Look for the value and how you will display them?
- Look at the examples and find a starting point for your project!

## Why you should know this

D3 is the data visualization library it does most everything. Besides working with D3 you will also need to work with your chosen dataset sorting, filtering, and aggregating data. Besides being job skills solving these challenges will make you better at your craft.

## Learning Objectives

1. Identify data visualization types 
1. Identify values and connect them to visuals
1. Form a strategy to complete the final

## Visualization Types 

Quick study this: https://www.data-to-viz.com

Question: How many values can you display in chart/graph/visualization?

Question: Which charts show ordered data? 

Question: What's the difference between a histogram and density plot?

Question: What's the difference between line and area charts/graphs?

<!-- > -->

## Datasets 

You need to find a dataset for the final project. Take a look at https://www.kaggle.com

Look for a dataset you want to work with. When considering a dataset ask yourself what values does it provide? How will display these values? What will you have to do to arrange, sort, or filter the data to display it?

## D3 Examples

## Lab - Part 1

Strategize your project plan:

- Find a dataset
- Identify the values you will display
- Decide what graph/chart style you will use to display them

<!-- > -->

## Lab Part 2

Start coding: 

- Find an example to work from
- Organize your data
  - filter values 
  - map values 
  - reduce values
  - sort 
- Plan the svg structure of the project
  - Investigate your example 
  - Plan the element structure/hierarchy of the svg document
