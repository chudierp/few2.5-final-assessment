## Overview

You should be working on your individual project and it will have problems to solve that will be unique to your ideas and dataset. Today we will have a workshop to solve problems. 

<!-- > -->

## D3 in Depth Guide 

Use this in depth guide to D3 to solve problems and find solutions. 

https://www.d3indepth.com

See the sections at the bottom of the page. 

If you're working with maps see the notes below.

## Learning Objectives

1. Solve problems with D3
1. Find and make use of resources

## How to measure the world?

The world is a globe and we've divided it into latitude and longitude.

**Read the following articles to better understand latitude and longitude**

- https://www.maptools.com/tutorials/lat_lon/definitions
- https://gisgeography.com/utm-universal-transverse-mercator-projection/

<!-- > -->

**In pairs, discuss why you would use latitude and longitude, and when you would use UTM**

Fun site: find geo-coordinates for your home town:

## Maps

Computer screens are flat. Maps displayed on computer screens are flat. If the world is described in coordinates, and the map is a globe, then it needs to be projected onto a flat surface. This is accomplished through some tricky math involving trigonometry.

_Luckily D3 provides a suite of functions that handle map projections for you!_

While it is great you don't have work out the math yourself you do have to understand that these projections are not perfect. Flattening a sphere onto a flat surface will always be imperfect.

## Discussion

In pairs, discuss the following:

- What is geojson?
	- https://geojson.org/
- Why do we need special projection models?
	- https://d3indepth.com/geographic/

We'll discuss as a class after 5 minutes of paired discussion.

## Mapping with D3 tutorial

This is a great tutorial on mapping with D3. It uses v5 so it's up to date. Besides that it was written by a cartographer!

- https://petrichor.studio/2018/05/21/get-started-creating-d3-maps/

**Read the blog post. Then create a map of your own. Use the sample code provided in the codepen example to recreate the example on your desktop.**

<!-- > -->

Be sure to follow up with the links at the bottom of the post, as these have valuable info on creating and using maps.

**Challenges**

- Make the map work using the same TopoJSON that the tutorial uses
- Try different projections

- Edit the CSS to change the color of the fill and stroke
