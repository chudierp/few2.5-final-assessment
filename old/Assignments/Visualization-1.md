# FEW 2.5 Visualization 1

## Visualizing data with HTML, CSS, and JS

Your goal is to create a visualization with HTML, CSS, and Javascript from the Titanic dataset. 

For this assignment, the goal is to make the most interesting visualization that you can. Don't worry about telling a story or making the data understandable. **Instead focus on making visuals that are interesting to look at.**

Use the size shape and color to make your work interesting. 

You should be writing code to make this work. Don't import any libraries. We will be talking about using libraries in class later. For now, you to understand how to things with raw JS. 

## Getting started

Follow these two tutorials:

| Depth        | Displays 2 values from the dataset | Displays 3 or 4 data points | Displays 5 or more data points |
| Code quality | There is code... | Code uses functions and is well organized | Code makes use of functions to minimize redundancy |
| Completion  | Seems incomplete, missing features from the description, is not on GitHub pages | Is on Github pages, has all feature from the homework description | Includes new features and expands on the homework description |
