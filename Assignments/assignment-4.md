# FEW 2.5 Visualization Final Project

Final project

## Goals 

Your goal is to choose your own dataset and create a visualization from that dataset. You should use D3 for this assignment. Though we can negotiate if your planned project would be better off using another system. 

## Why this project?

This is another opportunity to practice your JavaScript skills. 

D3 is large library that has been around for a long time it's the defato tool for visualizing. It can be used for more than visualizing data. Adding another interesting portfolio project.

## Choosing a dataset

You can choose any dataset you like. Choose something that it's interesting to you. Choose something that will inspire you to make great work!

Keep in mind that you'll be loading data into the browser, datasets can be very large, take note of the file size of the data you want to work with. 

Do your best to take this project as far as you can. 

Also keep in mind that you'll need to display the data. This means you need to idenitify the values in your chosen dataset and decide how these will get translated into pixels on the screen. Think about this carefully before starting to code!

## Getting started 

Your data may need some work before you will be able to display it. Some chart types require a plain list while others require a hierarchy or other arrangement. To reveal some stories about data you may need to sort or filter your data. Do all of this first! 

## Looking for ideas

Think about what type of chart you want to create. Not all charts are good for all data. Take a look at the charts here and read the notes:

Take a look at the examples here to get an idea of how to get started with D3:

	- Line
	- Area
	- Pack
	- Bubble
	- Hierarchy
	- Treemap
	- Pie/Arc
	- Axis
	- Scales

## Starting to code



## Deliverable

For the first stage of the project you need to define your project and find a dataset. 

| Expectation | Doe not meet | Meets | Exceeds |
|:-------------|:------------------|:----------------|:-----------------|
| **Dataset** | You don't have a dataset | You have a dataset | Your dataset inspires ideas for different ways you can express the data |
| **Strategy** | The data in your dataset doesn't work with the type of chart you're trying to create. For example Your data contains non-numeric dtaa and you want to create a line chart | Your dataset matches your chart type | You've studied https://www.data-to-viz.com to confirm your data is good fit for your chart type  |
| **Details** | You don't really know much about the data | Your data is a reasonable size and you understand the values it contains. | You have researched the data in your dataset and know the history and background. |
| **Story** | The chart you have created doesn't reveal anything new about your dataset | Your chart reveals new ideas about the data | Your chart tells a story about the data suggesting ideas that were not apparent in the numbers alone |
| **D3** | You can't explain or recreate what you have made with D3 | You can recreate and explain what you have created with D3 | You could recreate your work in D3 with another dataset or chart type |
